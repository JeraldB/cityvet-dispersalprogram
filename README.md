&nbsp; The City Veterinary Office (CVO) offers a livestock dispersal program that provides livelihood assistance to marginalized earners helping them overcome financial difficulties through agricultural acitivities and small business capital generation. This program aims to empower beneficiaries by equipping them with essential skills and resource for animal husbandry fostering sustainable income opportunities. However, it has been identified that there are oppurtunities for improvement in record keeping and tracking processes in city Veterinary division. Improving the program and enhancing the experience for the valued recipients is a top priority

There are several reasons why it is essential to monitor beneficiary information and track livestock production. Monitoring the production of every cattle and storing the data of new beneficiaries has a huge effect on the daily basis work of the division office. Livestock production and applying new beneficiaries have an impact on the City Veterinary Office since it directly affects their monitoring, tracking of the animals, and storing new data for the new recipients.

In response, The Team aims to design and develop a progressive web application that would provide beneficiaries and administrators of the City Veterinary Office with fill-up information on the daily production of livestock, applying new beneficiaries and dispersed animals to another recipient of the program. The Administrator of the program was provided to approve the changes of the new beneficiaries. For the development of the project,  tools such as Ionic framework, NoSQL, APIs and Angular.
